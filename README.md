# Task Tracker

Task Tracker is a full crud app that allows users to create a to do list to keep track to their tasks.

## Description

Tak Tracker is a code along project to help me learn Angular as well as getting familar with Angular new concepts with the help of Brad (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.Task Tracker includes 2 routes link to the about page and the home page. Depend on the page, each will contain different components. The home page will display the tasks, there is also a Add button for users to quickly add a task to their todo list. The About page does not have this button component. Users can navigate between pages, giving the users the experience of multiple pages application.

The backend of this project is a mock server using JSON Server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), this healps developers to create a quick back-end for prototyping and mocking



## Future Goals

Portfolio quality styling
Landing Page
Allow user to edit the tasks in case of typo, besides just simply toggle the reminder
Users auth

## Challenges

Angular is a big framework, the learning curve is stiffer than React because there are more to it. One of the challenges is how to manage the files and the logic between each components, which I found that sudo coding will help a lot.
The concepts behind subscription and subject are quite confusing but reading over the doc can also help with explaining some of the concepts.
